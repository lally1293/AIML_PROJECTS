# AIML_PROJECTS
# Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to my **Computer Vision Projects** repository! This repository contains small projects and experiments related to image processing, object tracking, color and letter recognition using Python.

Each project demonstrates practical applications of computer vision techniques, using tools like OpenCV and NumPy to process video and image data.

## üìÇ Projects

### ‚úÖ **color_recognition.py**
Detects and identifies different colors from a live video feed using a webcam. Useful for object sorting, interactive controls, and educational demonstrations.

### ‚úÖ **detect_skip_add.py**
Implements gesture detection algorithms that track specific hand movements, such as skipping or adding gestures. Can be extended for gesture-based user interfaces.

### ‚úÖ **fight.py**
Analyzes motion patterns in video to detect simulated "fight" or aggressive behavior. Can be used in surveillance, behavior analysis, or security projects.

### ‚úÖ **letters_recognition.py**
Recognizes handwritten or printed letters using image processing techniques. A foundational project for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems.

### ‚úÖ **objecttracking.py**
Tracks objects across video frames using feature tracking methods. Applicable in robotics, video analysis, and automated monitoring systems.
